Prerequisites and Setup:
Have Python installed (Python 3.8+ recommended)
Install required packages by running:
pip install langchain langchain_anthropic streamlit pypdf faiss-cpu sentence-transformers python-dotenv

Set up Anthropic API key:
Create a .env file in your project directory
Add your Anthropic API key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

Run the application:
python -m streamlit run app.py

How It Works:
Upload a PDF document through the Streamlit interface
Text extraction: The app uses PyPDF to extract all text from the document
Text chunking: The extracted text is split into manageable chunks (1000 characters with 200 character overlap)
Vector embeddings: HuggingFace's free all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model converts text chunks into numerical vectors that represent meaning
Similarity search: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) finds the most relevant chunks to the summarization task
LLM processing: Claude AI by Anthropic processes the most relevant chunks and generates a concise 5-8 sentence summary

Technologies Used:
LangChain: Framework that connects various components for LLM applications
FAISS: Efficient similarity search library for finding relevant document sections
HuggingFace: Provides free text embedding models
Anthropic's Claude: LLM that generates natural-sounding summaries
PyPDF: Library for extracting text from PDF files
Streamlit: Creates a simple web interface for the application
